# Repetition Structures Practice

## Related Chapter
- Chapter 4: Repetition Structures

## Topics Covered
- while loops
- for loops
- Loop control (break, continue)
- Counting and iteration
- Basic loop-based algorithms

## Tasks

### Task 5: Number Analyzer
- Takes a positive integer from the user
- Analyzes numbers from 1 to the given number
- Counts how many numbers are even and odd
- Displays the results to the user

### Task 6: Guess the Number
- The program randomly selects a number between 1 and 50
- The user tries to guess the number
- The program gives feedback until the correct number is guessed
- Displays the number of attempts

## Objective
These tasks aim to strengthen understanding of repetition structures by solving
problems that require repeated execution and iterative logic.
